    <h2>BJT Characteristics</h2>
    <h3>Bipolar junction diode</h3>
<P>BJT Characteristics and Operation:
   When biasing voltages are applied, the base emitter junction becomes forward biased whereas 
   the base collector junction is reverse biased. Potential barrier and depletion layer width at base 
   emitter junction reduces and both these quantities increase at collector base junction. As the 
   potential barrier at base emitter is reduced a large number of minority carriers are introduced 
   in to Base and the Emitter regions. A portion of the minority carriers reaching the base 
   recombines with majority carriers. The rest, defuse to the edge of the depletion region at 
   collector-base where they are swept away to the collector region by the large electric field. 
   Under this condition the transistor is said to be in the Active region</P>
